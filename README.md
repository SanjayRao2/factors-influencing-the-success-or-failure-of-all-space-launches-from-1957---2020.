The project compares the performance of three different classification algorithms: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting. The output variable, or the target variable, is "Status Mission," which indicates whether a space mission was successful or not. This variable is binary, with values typically denoting success - 1 or failure - 0. The input variables capture various aspects related to space launches, namely “Country, Launch year, rocket company name, rocket type and status of the rocket”. So, in total 5 input variables.

This project holds significant importance as it dives into the realm of space travel, a topic of immense interest for an enthusiast like me. By analyzing rocket launch missions, it unravels the foundational aspect of space exploration, showcasing how these missions are pivotal in advancing our understanding of the cosmos and fostering technological advancements crucial for humanity's progress. Ultimately, the insights learnt from this project can contribute to improving the success rates of space missions, thereby facilitating safer and more efficient exploration of outer space.

The 3 algorithms used are: 
•	Logistic Regression
•	Random Forest
•	Gradient Boosting


The output variable, or the target variable, is "Status Mission," which indicates whether a space mission was successful or not. This variable is binary, with values typically denoting success - 1 or failure - 0.

The input variables are: 
•	Country: Country where the Rocket is launched (Also manufactured in most cases)
•	Year: Year of Launch
•	Company name: Name of the Rocket company
•	Rocket status: Status of the rocket if it is still active or retired.
•	Rocket Type: The model of the rocket 

Conclusion: In this project, I conducted a comprehensive analysis of space missions spanning from 1957 to 2020, aiming to predict mission outcomes using machine learning algorithms. By utilizing Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting, I sought to understand the influence of various factors such as country, launch year, and rocket details on mission success or failure.
Through extensive exploratory data analysis, I gained valuable insights into the distribution and relationships among the input variables. This phase provided a deeper understanding of the dataset and potential patterns influencing mission outcomes. Subsequently, I optimized and evaluated multiple machine learning models through hyperparameter tuning, ensuring robust predictive performance. I found that Logistic Regression performed the best in predicting space mission outcomes.
After careful evaluation of model performance metrics and cross-validation results, I selected the best-performing model for predicting space mission outcomes. This project underscores the significance of leveraging data-driven approaches to enhance decision-making in the space industry, ultimately contributing to the advancement of space exploration and technology for the benefit of humanity.
